# Prework - ColorSwitch

Submitted by: Alisha Kuoch

ColorSwitch is an app that displays a simple screen with three labels and a button. When the button is tapped, the background color of the screen changes to a randomly generated color. 

Time spent: ~2 hours total (including installing Xcode and updating software).

App Idea 
My idea is to create an improved version of the Goodreads app. This app would have a cleaner, more user friendly design and better features for finding and connecting with other users. Some features I'd like to include are improved search so users can find friends without exact spelling of their name, less cluttered UI, smarter algorithms that recommend not only books but short video content, and easier navigation through bookshelves and reading histories.

## Notes

The only challenge I encountered while creating the app was the set up process. It took awhile to find certain panels and get used to switching between them.
